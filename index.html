                <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
                <b>Ravioli Ravioli</b> and <b>PenGUI</b> are HCI projects that center on animated touch-based and sensor based interface for a mobile device that provide an alternative to 'slide to unlock'. It was made in collaboration between Sophia
                Le, Marela Carlos, and Daniel Tiu.
                <div class="float-left"><img src="assets/pengui.gif"></div> This page documents the iterative design process that lead to our final products that demonstrated two different techniques with:
                <ul>
                    <li>One based on gesture or multi-touch input </li>
                    <li>The other based on sensor input (e.g. for one-hand use).</li>
                </ul>
                Examples of sensor are accelerometer, gyroscope, light, camera, etc. Our products use animation to provide feedback that the system is recognizing the action being taken, and how the system then unlocks the device after the action is completed. Accidental
                Accidental activation is avoided due the comprehensive and thorough design of our techniques.

                The first iteration of our design process consisted of each group member sketching 10+ ideas. Here, our top 7 sketches out of the 30+ are shown. <iframe scrolling="no" class="slider" src="slider1.html" title="W3Schools Free Online Web Tutorials">

                The main idea for Interface A was the selection of button items. We chose this idea because it was simple and intuitive from a user perspective. It also gave us some freedom to be creative in the items we chose for our demo. Part A was developed using
                Javascript, and features a red unlocked button upon successful passcode entry. The user simply has to press this red unlock button when they want to lock their phone again, confirmed by the green lock symbol. For Interface B, we decided
                to moved forward with the idea of warming up our penguin using the proximity sensor. The sensor senses the distance between the hand and the phone and unlocks it if a specific distance is measured. We chose this for our implementation
                because we liked the idea of warming up a character and thought the proximity sensor could be interesting to use for the basic task of unlocking your phone. This implementation is a prototype, with the mockup done on Figma, and the sensor
                functionality and animations done using Protopie. To enhance the user experience, we added phone vibrations along with on-screen modals to give users feedback on their actions. For this implementation, we found a detail about the proximity
                sensor on iPhones in which we realized it was the sensor responsible for making the screen go black when you make a call on your phone to prevent accidental button presses with your ear. That being said, this cannot be disabled on the
                iPhone so we devised a technique for the prototype to prevent the black screen from showing up in the demo that could be confusing without knowing the above context. Below is a video summarizing the iterative design process for our interfaces
                A and B.
